# About Me
I bring hands-on and advisory experience working with large enterprises, vendors, and system integrators. I have led discovery phases, architecture assessments, and cloud-native evaluations, working closely with engineering teams, product owners, vendors, and executives.

My approach is structured and outcome-driven:

- Understand business and technical constraints

- Assess current-state architecture and delivery maturity

- Identify gaps, risks, and improvement opportunities

- Define a realistic, phased implementation roadmap
